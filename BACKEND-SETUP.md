# Three Kingdoms: Conquest — Backend Setup Guide
### Google Sign-In · Cloud saves · True cross-device leaderboard

The game works fully offline, but with this backend deployed you get: players sign in with Google (server-verified, unhijackable), progress that follows them across every device, one real global leaderboard, and cheat guardrails.

## 1. Architecture at a glance

```
 game (three-kingdoms-conquest.html)      admin console (admin.html)
        │  HTTPS/JSON                            │  X-Admin-Key
        ▼                                        ▼
 ┌──────────────────────── server/server.js ────────────────────────┐
 │  POST /api/auth/google   verify Google ID token → session (JWT)  │
 │  GET/PUT /api/profile    load/save the player's full profile     │
 │  GET  /api/leaderboard   top-25 lifetime merit + weekly top-5    │
 │  POST /api/weekly        submit weekly-challenge time            │
 │  GET  /api/adcfg         shared ad/music/difficulty config       │
 │  /api/admin/*            players list, clear pin, adcfg, resets  │
 └──────────────────┬───────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    ▼
              data.sqlite  (players, weekly, config tables)
```

Security model: the client never proves identity itself. Google issues an ID token, the **server** verifies it against Google's keys (`google-auth-library`), then issues its own 30-day session token (HMAC-signed JWT). Profile writes have guardrails: lifetime merit and wins can only increase, and only by sane per-save increments.

## 2. Create the Google OAuth client (5 minutes)

1. Go to **console.cloud.google.com** → create (or pick) a project.
2. *APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen*: External, app name "Three Kingdoms Conquest", add your email. Publish.
3. *APIs & Services → Credentials → Create credentials → OAuth client ID*:
   - Application type: **Web application**
   - **Authorized JavaScript origins**: the exact origin(s) where the game is served, e.g. `https://game.yourdomain.com` (and `http://localhost:8080` for testing).
4. Copy the **Client ID** (ends in `.apps.googleusercontent.com`).

> Google Sign-In requires the game to be served over **https** from a real origin (localhost is allowed for testing). It will not work from a `file://` double-clicked page — that's why the game keeps the local name/passcode mode as a fallback.

## 3. Deploy the server

Works on any Node 18+ host: a $5 VPS, Render, Railway, Fly.io, etc.

```bash
cd server
npm install
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="xxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com" \
ADMIN_KEY="choose-a-long-random-string" \
JWT_SECRET="another-long-random-string" \
ALLOW_ORIGIN="https://game.yourdomain.com" \
node server.js            # listens on :8787 (override with PORT=)
```

Environment variables:

| Var | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | yes | The OAuth client ID from step 2 |
| `ADMIN_KEY` | yes | Secret the admin console sends in `X-Admin-Key` |
| `JWT_SECRET` | recommended | Session signing key (random if unset — sessions reset on restart) |
| `ALLOW_ORIGIN` | recommended | CORS lockdown to your game's domain |
| `PORT` / `DB_PATH` | optional | Defaults `8787` / `./data.sqlite` |

Put it behind HTTPS (Caddy, nginx + certbot, or your PaaS does it automatically).

**Backup** = copy `data.sqlite` (it's the whole database: players, weekly boards, shared config).

---

## 4. Wire the game and the admin console

1. Open `three-kingdoms-conquest.html`, find the config block at the top of the script:
   ```js
   const BACKEND_URL = '';   →   const BACKEND_URL = 'https://api.yourdomain.com';
   ```
2. Host the game file on the origin you registered in step 2. The login screen now shows a **"Sign in with Google"** button under the local login; players who use it get cloud saves and appear on the true global leaderboard. Local name/passcode play keeps working for everyone else.
3. Open `admin.html`, choose **Connect to server**, enter your backend URL and `ADMIN_KEY`. You can now manage ads, music, difficulty, and players for the live deployment. (The **Unlock local mode** path still manages a same-origin static deployment without a backend.)

## 5. API quick reference

| Endpoint | Auth | Body / Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/config` | — | `{googleClientId}` |
| `POST /api/auth/google` | — | `{credential}` → `{token, profile}` |
| `GET /api/profile` | Bearer | `{profile}` |
| `PUT /api/profile` | Bearer | `{profile}` → `{ok}` (guardrails applied) |
| `GET /api/leaderboard` | — | `{top:[{name,merit,wins,best,rank}], weekly:[{name,time}], week}` |
| `POST /api/weekly` | Bearer | `{time}` → `{ok}` (keeps the best) |
| `GET /api/adcfg` | — | `{adcfg}` shared ad/music/difficulty config |
| `GET /api/admin/ping` | X-Admin-Key | `{ok}` |
| `GET /api/admin/players` | X-Admin-Key | `{players:[…]}` |
| `POST /api/admin/clear-pin` | X-Admin-Key | `{name}` → `{ok}` |
| `GET/PUT /api/admin/adcfg` | X-Admin-Key | shared config read/write |
| `POST /api/admin/reset-leaderboard` | X-Admin-Key | zeroes merit/wins, clears weekly |

## 6. Roadmap ideas the schema already supports

- **Live PvP**: add a WebSocket layer (`ws` package) with a match table; both clients send orders, the server simulates the battle authoritatively. The deterministic engine (seeded maps, fixed tick) was written with this in mind.
- **Seasons**: snapshot `players.merit_life` monthly into a `seasons` table; reward top ranks with exclusive badges.
- **Cross-device ad config**: the game can be extended to fetch `/api/adcfg` at boot so admin changes propagate instantly to all devices.
